# Intelligent-Roomba
this is a project using A* Algorithm

There will be 2d squares where  walls can't  be accessed by the roomba otherwise roomba's task will be to clean the dirty squares. 
there will be 4 charging points where roomba will be able to recharge if it becomes 0 charge. . 
you need to run roomba's heuristic code to see how the roomba performs its job
